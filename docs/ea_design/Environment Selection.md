# Environment Selection
For environment selection, we decide to use a hybrid version of generational and $(\mu + \lambda)$ where generational adapts the "new me" replace "old me" concept and $(\mu + \lambda)$ for creating new individuals when some of the individuals reach their death age.

There are several ways to deal with "dead" individuals' assets:
- heritage (uniform distribute to a group of individuals)
- straight delete (the assets die with the individual)
- uniform distribution (uniform distribute to every individual)
- lucky guy (an individual will inherit all the asset)

Every individual's current age will +=1
